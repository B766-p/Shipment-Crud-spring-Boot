# Shipment CRUD Spring Boot Application

## Overview

The Shipment CRUD Spring Boot application is a web application that allows users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on shipment records. This project serves as a practical example of building a RESTful API using Spring Boot and a relational database.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete shipment records.
- Input validation for shipment data.
- Exception handling for error management.
- RESTful API endpoints for interaction.
- Basic security features (optional).
- Unit and integration testing.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the application.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For data access and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).
- **Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or H2 (choose one).
- **Maven/Gradle**: For dependency management and build automation.
- **JUnit**: For testing the application.
- **Postman**: For testing API endpoints.
